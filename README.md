## description 

1. Here MultiLinear Regression Model is Implimented From Scratch Using Python 
2. Data set taking here is housing price data set with independent variables ---> [PlotSize, Number Of BedRooms, Number Of BathRooms] and Dependent Variable ---> [Housing Unit Price]
3. A Predictor is designed using Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Algorithm and mini batch Gradient Descent algorithms (determining minibatch size is your choice- here it could be 10, 20, 30 etc.) with and without feature scaling and  their performances is compared in terms of % error in prediction.(only allowed to use NumPy library of Python, no other functions/libraries are allowed) 
4. Predictor is designed using Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Algorithm and mini batch Gradient Descent algorithms (determining minibatch size is your choice- here it could be 10, 20, 30 etc.) with and without regularization and their performances is compared in terms of % error in prediction.(only allowed to use the NumPy library of Python, no other functions/libraries are allowed)
5. LWR algorithm is implimented on the Housing Price data set with different tau values. Find out the tau value which will provide the best fit predictor. 

## Math behind Implimentation
